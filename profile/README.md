**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Direct Drive Technology was found in 2020, committed to using direct drive motors to replace the reduction gear in any machine,making the original delicate and noisy traditonal robot reborn.

Direct Drive Technology Robotics Team was setup since 2022, mainly focus on mobile robots such as bipedal-wheel robot and quadruped-wheel robot. We also use the modualized designing method to design our robot.

Here are some samples about our work in modulized bipedal-wheel robot and quadruped-wheel robot :
