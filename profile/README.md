**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Direct Drive Technology was found in 2020, committed to using direct drive motors to replace the reduction gear in any machine,making the original delicate and noisy traditonal robot reborn.

Direct Drive Technology Robotics Team was setup since 2022, mainly focus on mobile robots such as [bipedal-wheel robot](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1tM4y1Z7VY?spm_id_from=player_end_recommend_autoplay&vd_source=8ab3473c3214c5120c93d5ac5fbba539) and [quadruped-wheel robot](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Pn4y1R7eg/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click). We also use the [modualized designing method](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gf42117yt/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=8ab3473c3214c5120c93d5ac5fbba539) to design our robot.
